This port focusses to align with BTA values and as such takes liberties with some of the ported features. 
The port has strived to set itself apart and as such many things were changed, sometime small and sometimes in a big way.
Given the scope of the project, we thought it would be best if there were a way for people to look things up themselves.
The wikis goal is to be informative and up-to-date.

**This wiki is maintained solely by volunteers.**

**This wiki is made for the Better with Aether a port of the Aether 1.02 for BTA. We have no relation to the Aether team or the BTA team.**
