# Better with Aether - Wiki
Welcome to the official Better with Aether, community-maintained wiki.

![Paradise](docs/assets/paradise.png)

Better with Aether offers something for everyone. Whether you like to build castles, explore the land, or conquer dangerous dungeons, there’s always an adventure waiting.  
Build with a vast array of blocks and collect countless new items. Explore a beautiful, expansive realm and learn to survive its many deadly enemies. And if you're up for a challenge, attempt to conquer the three dungeons scattered across the lands. At the end of each dungeon, a powerful boss awaits. Defeat them, and riches beyond your wildest dreams will be yours.  
Don’t fret, you don’t have to face these challenges alone. Set up a server and enjoy this beautiful and unnerving paradise with friends. We strive to keep this mod fully compatible with as many other mods as possible.

This mod is a remade version of the Aether 1.02 for BTA. We have no relation to the Aether team or the BTA team.
