# About the Wiki
The section details the need and reason for the wiki. If you want to contribute to the wiki please read [Contributions](contribution.md). 

## Intro
This is a faithful, mostly, port of the [Aether](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275355-1-7-3-aether-collaboration-mod-v1-02-new-mobs) to the fork of minecraft b1.7.3 [Better then Adventure](https://www.betterthanadventure.net/) (BTA). This port focusses to align with BTA values and as such takes liberties with some of the ported features. 
The port has strifed to set itself apart and as such many things were changed, sometime small and sometimes in a big way.
Given the scope of the project, we thought it would be best if there were a way for people to look things up themselves. 

## Purpose
This wiki exist for 3 reasons:

- The project first and foremost focusses to keep the same attention to detail as <span style="color: #ba2b15ff;">BTA</span> itself. As such changes were made to better align with these. As such features were added to blocks, items and entities that exist in <span style="color: lightblue;">BTA</span> but not the original <span style="color: #47aae4ff;">Aether</span>.
- The targeted version of <span style="color: lightblue;">Aether</span> is a b1.7.3 release. Despite been a great mod, it is not perfect. There are a lot of bug that have been fixed.
- Let be honest the years were not kind to <span style="color: lightblue;">Aether</span> and it can be seeing in the incomplete and mostly abandoned wikis that can be found online. This wiki does not seek to be a decent lookup. This wiki does not strife to a full fletched wiki. As such it will destine a lot of information into the essential and where the behavior has not change refer to the original wiki's([The Aether Project Wiki](https://aether.wiki.gg/) and [Aether Fandom Wiki](https://aether.fandom.com/wiki/The_Aether_I)).
