# About
The section details the need and reason for the wiki. If you want to contribute to the wiki please read [Contributions](contribution.md). 

## Intro
This is a faithful, mostly, port of the [Aether](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275355-1-7-3-aether-collaboration-mod-v1-02-new-mobs) to the fork of minecraft b1.7.3 [Better then Adventure](https://www.betterthanadventure.net/) (BTA). This port focusses to align with BTA values and as such takes liberties with some of the ported features. 
The port has strived to set itself apart and as such many things were changed, sometime small and sometimes in a big way.
Given the scope of the project, we thought it would be best if there were a way for people to look things up themselves. 

## Purpose
This wiki exist for 3 reasons:

- The project first and foremost focusses to keep the same attention to detail as <span style="color: #9f1b07ff;">**BTA**</span> itself. As such changes were made to better align with these. As such features were added to blocks, items and entities that exists in <span style="color: #9f1b07ff;">**BTA**</span> but not the original <span style="color: #c48e07ff;">**Aether**</span>.   
- The targeted version of <span style="color: #c48e07ff;">**Aether**</span> is a b1.7.3 release. Despite been a great mod, it is not perfect. There are a lot of bug that have been fixed. Some aspects of the original mod had its short comings and such were refined.  
- Let be honest the years were not kind to <span style="color: #c48e07ff;">**Aether**</span> and it can be seen in the incomplete and mostly abandoned wikis that can be found online. This wiki does not seek to replace them but be commentary lookup. As such the wiki will concentrate on delivering where the behavior has changed compare to the original or is absence from the other wikis. For everything else we going to keep this brief and more comprehensive lookup can be done at any of the other wikis [The Aether Project Wiki](https://aether.wiki.gg/) or [Aether Fandom Wiki](https://aether.fandom.com/wiki/The_Aether_I).
