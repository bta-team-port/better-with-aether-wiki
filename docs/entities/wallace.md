Welcome victim, for you have survived wallace and made it here. Let talk wallace.

## What is Wallace
Mimic are great, but none are as great as Wallace. Some say that Wallace is a myth, others believe Wallace is real, and yet others believe Wallace is something in between. Truth be told Wallace is a legend. Wallace is much stronger and much tougher than normal mimic. Wallace takes only half the damage while dealing twice the damage of typical mimic.

## Find Wallace
Wallace can rarely spawn instead mimic in Mazes and Temple. Wallace is quite rare- The odds are 1:256 for a mimic to be a wallace.
Spotting Wallace is quite easy. Wallace spots a deep bruting shiny purple polish and a label to boot. 

## I found Wallace
As an avid Wallace survivor, I advise you to run.
