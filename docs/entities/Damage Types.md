Better With Aether introduces two new damage types: Lightning and Holy. These damage types help further distinguish enemies and weapons, while allowing armor to follow BWA’s core philosophy thus ensuring that no existing armor set becomes obsolete.
As such existing armor sets were expanded with resistance to the new damage types as well.

## Resitance

  <figure style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0; text-align: center;">
    <img src="/images/resistance.png" alt="Resistance bar shown with negative resistance" style="display: block; max-width: 400px;">
    <figcaption style="font-style: italic; color: #555; font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 5px;">

    <p style="margin-top: -5px;">
      Both damage types give by default negative resistance. To visualize the resistance, the resistance interface was adjusted to show negative values as well. Negative values are indicated by a color spectrum from magenta, low values, to deep blue, high values.
      Different armor have different amount of resistance. As such player would need to mix and match to maximize their resistance for upcomming adventures. For more information on exact values see the article about <a href="../../items/armor/">Armor</a>.<br>

      The minimum damage a player can take from holy and lightning is half a hearts. The damage increases linearly with negative resistance. As such <span style="color: #bb0c0aff;">-70</span> resistance will increase the damage take from lightning by <span style="color: #067c25ff;">+70</span>, as such the a sword doing 5 <span style="color: #bb0c0aff;">❤</span> of damage will do 8.5 <span style="color: #bb0c0aff;">❤</span> hearts.

## Holy
Most of sources of holy damage are related to valkyries. As such the Valkyries and their queen do primary holy damage.
Also related items to them such as the valkyrie tool deal holy damage.
Other items include the Holy Sword and Remedy Dart. Most armor offers positive resistance to holy damage. The notable exceptions are diamond, zanite and obsidian.

## Lightning
Most sources of lightning damage are from related items such Lightning Sword and Lightning knife. During the second phase of Valkyrie Queen bossfight the projectle spawned does lightning damage too.
Unlike holy damage most armor provide poor resistance agains lightning damage. Notable example of good lightning resistance are leather, diamond, zanite and obsidian.
Finaly lightning strikes now also causes lightning damage.
