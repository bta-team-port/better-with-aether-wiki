Mimics can be found in both the Maze and the Temple.
They are indistinguishable from regular chests.
Attempting to open a mimic chest will spawn a <a href="../../entities/mimic">Mimic</a>.
Players cannot avoid triggering a mimic by mining the chest, unless the player is wearing a <a href="../../items/accessories/pendant">gold pendant</a> and using the proper axe. 
In that case the mimic is mined and dropped as a block that can be picked up and placed.
While in block form the mimic retains all item that it previously held.
