## Block Mimic
Mimics can be found in both the Maze and the Temple.
<div>
  <p> 
  Mimics can appear disguised as any type of chest, mimicking Oak, Skyroot and even Dungeon Chests.
  Just like chests, mimic can be picked up and moved.
  As a block mimic can be easily dispatched.
  As a block Mimics can be placed in traps, crushed by pistons, or detonated for a quick kill.
  </p>
  <p>
  However, since they are indistinguishable from regular chests, players may accidentally open them.
  Opening a mimic chest will spawn the mob <a href="../../entities/mimic">Mimic</a>.
  Players cannot avoid triggering this by mining the chest, unless the player is wearing a <a href="../../items/accessories/pendant">gold pendant</a> and using the proper tool.
  Players must choose the appropriate tool based on the Mimic’s appearance.
  For example, when a mimic camouflages itself as a Skyroot Chest, it requires an aether axe to be mined.
  When properly mined, the Mimic drops as a block that can be picked up and placed. While in this block form, it retains all items it previously held.
  The method for obtaining a Mimic as a block is the same in all modes.
  </p>
  <p>
  In Creative mode or peaceful mod, players can open Block Mimics inventory without spawning the Mimic itself.
  To trigger a Mimic in creative, the player must left click it while wielding a sword.
  In peaceful mode, Mimics cannot be triggered and behave like ordinary chests.
  Like other mobs, players can rename their Mimic, with the name appearing in its inventory while its a block and above them in mob from.

## Mob Mimic
Once the trap is sprung it spawns the mimic. 
The mimic is hostile chest like mob with a large aggression range.
They take extra damage from the mining tool of the block, they disguise themselves as.
For example, if a mimic camouflages itself as a wooden chest, it will take increased damage from axes.
On death, a mimic drops all items that its chest form contained, as well as the chest itself.
If a mimic cannot find a player, it will wander briefly before turning back into a block.
When a chest or another mimic is present, the mimic adapts its form to that chest or mimic type.
