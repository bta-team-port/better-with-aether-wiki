While the Aether is a harsh and hostile environment many mob thrive.
You can find all sort of creature from deadly flora to tame giant.
Since many hostile creatures can spawn during daylight, it is advised to torch the area with ambrosium torches to scare them away.

### Phyg, Phow and Moa
<div style="overflow: hidden;"> 
    <p>
    Phyg and Phow are similar to their overworld counterpart.
    However unlike their overworld counterpart they can be freely ridden around.
    All the player requires is a saddle, which can be crafted with leather, an iron igot and string.
    Despite having wings Phyg and Phow cannot fly and are gliding instead.
    Phyg and Phow have increased jump height and allow the player to perform an additional midair jump.
    </p>
    <p>
    Unlike Phyg and Phow, wild Moas cannot be ridden.
    To get a ridable Moa, player have to find the corresponding eggs and hatch in the incubator.
    Moas come in tree different colors.
    The different colored Moas differ only in the number of midair jumps they have.
    Blue Moas can perform three midair jumps, white Moas can perform five, and black Moas have the most with seven.

### Aerbunny
Aerbunnies can be found throughout the Aether.
They can be equipped by the player, allowing them to perform a midair jump.
Midair jumps can only be used after falling a short distance.
Aerbunnies are safe from suffocation while equipped, when walking through low corridors.

### Sheepuff

Sheepuff are aethers very fluffy sheep. 
They can be sheared just like sheep, but unlike sheep, Sheepuff can be sheared twice.
This also means they need to eat twice as much to reach the same level of fluffiness.
Rarest colored Sheepuff is purple followed by pink.

## Monster
### Zephyr
Zephyrs are cloud looking flying enemies found high among the clouds.
They spawn on [White Aercloud](../blocks/blocks.md) and [Golden Aercloud](../blocks/blocks.md) scattered throughout Aether.
Despite their size they are capable of navigating through the skies by phasing through the White and Golden Aerclouds.
Zephyr are hostile and shoot Wind Charges at the player.
Wind Charge apply on hit will knockback to the mob they hit.
Zephyr, unlike other monster, wont stay mad at the player forever.
Lastly Zephyr are weak and an additional take 5 <span class="heart"></span> from [Darts](../items/tools/ranged_tools.md).


### Aechor Plant
Just as Mimics camouflage themselves among Chests, Aechor Plants do the same with flowers.
Aechor Plants generate in the same colors as Argyony Flowers and Porlea Flowers, along with a Cyan variant.
Their primary way off fighting is firing [poison needles](../effects/damage_type.md).
While individual are not dangerous they can be easily overlooked.
Destroying underneath the plant kills it instantly.
Fire is also an effective option, dealing double damage.
Alternatively, players can use [Remedy Darts](../items/tools/ranged_tools.md) to eliminate enemies quickly, thanks to their additional 6 <span class="heart"></span> of damage toward them.
Despite these weaknesses Aechor Plant are immune to poison.
Lastly they require daylight to spawn and despite providing light, ambroium torches prevent their spawning.

### Cockatrice
Cockatrice are hostile bird like creature that spawn in dark. 
At a glance they look and sound like Moas and thus can be easily confused.
A flock of these birds can usually be found on the underside of cliffs.
Just like the Aechor Plants they shoot poisonous needles and take additional 6 <span class="heart"></span> of damage from Remedy Darts.
Lastly Cockatrice are immune to poison.
 

### Swets and Golden Swets
Swets look and act just like Slime.
But as with many things in the Aether they are deceptively strong.
Once a Swet gets too close to the player, it will grab them and quickly suffocate them while launching itself sky-high, adding fall damage to the attack.
The suffocation deals combat damage, so players are advised to bring strong combat gear.
While the Swet is not immune to fall damage, it only takes 50% damage from falls.
Player can escape the grab by either killing the Swet or sneaking (shift clicking).
Golden Swets are just more deadly variant of the normal Swet.
They deal increased damage and jump higher, thus amplifying the fall damage.


### Whirly
Whirlers are small tornadoes whizzing around in the aether. 
They leave a trail of item in their path.
Friendly Whirlies leave a trail of items in their path. They can leave behind the following items:

 - Zanite
 - Aechor Petal
 - Ambrosium
 - Aether Dirt
 - Icestone
 - Skyroot Stick
 - Amber
 - Skyroot Log
 - Quicksoil.

### Tempest
Tempest are the evil twin of the Whirly.

## Dungeons Denizens
Each dungeon houses it own suite of unique creatures. Passive and hostile mobs do not usually spawn there.
Most of denizens do not follow conventional spawning mechanics. Instead most enemies spawned from players triggering a <a href="../../blocks/dungeon_blocks">trapped blocks</a>.
All denizens of the dungeons are immune to poison.

### Sentry
Sentries are buried the floor of the bronze dungeon.
After the trap is sprung, the Sentry begins to follow the player and explodes upon reaching them.
Given the room's height, players can sustain heavy fall damage from repeated launches into the air.
It is advised to wear some blast and fall protection while exploring the Maze.
Sentries are immune to drowning and getting impalement by spikes or cacti, but otherwise take damage normally. 
Additionally, they take double damage from pickaxes and have low health, making them easy to dispatch.
Sentries do not spawn in peaceful mode.

### Valkyrie
Valkyries are Angle like creature livin in the [Temple](../world_features/dungeons/temple.md).
Valkyries are usually hidden and spring forward when a trap block is triggered.
They remain passive until the player engages them in combat.
In combat Valkyries strike player doing holy damage.
It is advised to have strong holy resistance against Valkyries.
At the same time, players should avoid dealing holy damage themselves, as Valkyries only take half damage from it.
While in combat, Valkyries will teleport around, attacking from unpredictable directions.
Additionally Valkyries can scale fences and short walls so players cannot rely on physical barriers for safety.
Once they are bested they will drop an victory medal.
Ten Medals are required to fight the <a href="../../entities/boss">Valkyrie Queen</a>.
Should you perish in combat, they will playfully tease and laugh at you, then return to a passive state.
Valkyries are immune to damage while they are in the passive state and cannot be harmed in any way.

Player can initiate a conversation with Valkyries, by right clicking them.
Valkyries reactions vary depending on how many medals the players presents them with (right clicks with).
Unlike sentries, they can spawn in peaceful mode.
However player cannot them in combat and any attempt to do so will cause them to teleport away.

### Fireminion
Despite having a dedicated <a href="../../blocks/dungeon_blocks">trap block</a>, no such blocks spawn naturally.
As such only their boss <a href="../../entities/boss">the Sunspirit</a> can summon them.
During them boss fight the Sunspirit will 
Fireminion are aggressive and have true sight making them capable seeing invisible players.
They are immune to all forms of fire damage and, despite being made of literal fire, can breathe underwater.
In combat they deal a mixture of fire and combat damage.
Player are advised to gear appropriately.

### Others
<a href="../../entities/minic">Mimics</a> and <a href="../../entities/boss">bosses</a> are more complex and have more mechanics than other mobs. Because of this, they each have their own articles.
