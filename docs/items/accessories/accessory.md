One of the biggest changes in Better with Aether are the accessories.
The original Aether has equipment slots in abundance.
Many of these slots only have one item filling them.
As such in the port, we cut down many of these slots.
Most accessories have been given some function to make up for them being originally cosmetic.
Ring were cut, because they were similar to pendants, however where pendant were rendered on the player and ring were not.
As such rings, shield, wildcard and pendant slot were combined into the trinket slot.
Given these massive change, this wiki will be dedicated to explain these slots in more detail as well as talk about the various items that have undergone changes.
