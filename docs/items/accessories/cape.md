In Aether, players can equip capes to adorn their backs.
Of the 18 available capes, only three serve a practical purpose, the rest are purely decorative.

## Agility Cape, Swet Cape and Invisibility Cloak
Agility cape increases the player agility allowing him to scale one block high walls without jumping.
This effect is useful for traversing the Aether due to its jagged terrain.
The Invisibility cloak give the player [Invisibility](../../effects/effects.md#invisibility) and the Swet cape gives [Swetty](../../effects/effects.md#swetty).
Both capes are useful tool for combat and traversal.
