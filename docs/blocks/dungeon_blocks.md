Aethers dungeon are filled with unique blocks that cannot be found anywhere else.
Some spawn monster, others are blast resistant and other again are purely decoration.
Each dungeon features its own unique palette of <a href="../blocks">carved and light blocks</a>. 
These block cannot be crafted and can only be found within the dungeon. 

## Locked Blocks
Dungeon blocks within the boss arena are locked by default.
Locked blocks behave exactly like their unlocked counterparts, with two key exceptions: they cannot be mined and they cannot be pushed.
Once the boss is defeated, all locked blocks automatically become unlocked.
Both carved and light block can be locked.
Unlike the carved block, which is identical to the unlocked version, the light block loses some of its light output.

## Trapped Blocks
Among the many decorative blocks that make up the dungeon’s exterior and interior are Trapped Blocks. When a player walks over a trapped block a creature is released and block goes on cooldown.
In the <a href="../../world_featrues/dungeon/maze">Maze</a>, these blocks spawn hostile <a href="../../entities/boss">sentries</a>, while in the <a href="../../world_featrues/dungeon/temple">Temple</a> they spawn peaceful <a href="../../entities/boss">valkyries</a>.
A trapped block can only be activated by a player, but it can be triggered repeatedly, releasing additional enemies.
Players in creative also have access to hellfire trap blocks spawning <a href="../../entities/boss">fireminions</a>.
Additionally sentries and fireminions cannot be spawned by the trapped block while in peaceful mode.
Lastly  
trapped blocks can also spawn locked.

Once the boss fight begins, a dungeon door appears, preventing players inside the arena from leaving.
While players already in the fight cannot exit, players outside can still join by right-clicking the door.
When either all players inside die or the boss is defeated, the door disappears, allowing free movement in and out of the arena.
