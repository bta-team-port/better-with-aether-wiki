Aethers dungeon are filled with unique blocks that cannot be found anywhere else.
Some spawn monster, others are blast resistant and other again are purely decoration.
Each dungeon features its own unique palette of <a href="../blocks">carved blocks</a>. These block cannot be crafted and can only be found within the dungeon.
## Locked Blocks
Dungeon blocks within the boss arena are locked by default. Locked blocks behave exactly like their unlocked counterparts, with two key exceptions: they cannot be mined and they cannot be pushed. Once the boss is defeated, all locked blocks automatically become unlocked.

## Trapped Blocks
Among the many decorative blocks that make up the dungeon’s exterior and interior are Trapped Blocks. When a player walks over a trapped block a creature is released and block goes on cooldown. In the <a href="../../world_featrues/dungeon/maze">Maze</a>, these blocks spawn hostile <a href="../../entities/boss">Sentries</a>, while in the <a href="../../world_featrues/dungeon/temple">Temple</a> they spawn peaceful Valkyries. A trapped block can only be activated by a player, but it can be triggered repeatedly, releasing additional enemies. Players in creative also have access to hellfire trap blocks spawning fireminions. 

## Dungeon Door
Once the boss fight begins, a dungeon door appears, preventing players inside the arena from leaving. While players already in the fight cannot exit, players outside can still join by right-clicking the door. When either all players inside die or the boss is defeated, the door disappears, allowing free movement in and out of the arena.

## Treasure Chest
The treasure chest hold the loot from a given boss. It cannot be mined nor moved, however it can be picked up and carried away.
After defeating the boss of the dungeons player are given a <a href="../../items/items">key</a> that can be used to unlock the chest.
Unlike in survival, the chest is accessible without a key in creative allowing map maker to populate the chest content with item of their own choice. Additionally treasure chest can be spawned via `/place` command.

## Mimic
Mimics can be found in both the Maze and the Temple. They are indistinguishable from regular chests. Attempting to open a mimic chest will spawn a <a href="../../entities/mimic">Mimic</a>. Players cannot avoid triggering a mimic by mining the chest, however if the player has a <a href="../../items/accessories/pendant">Gold Pendant</a> equipped as well a proper axe, they can safely mine the mimic instead. When mined, the mimic drops as a block that can be picked up and placed. All items stored inside the mimic are preserved within the block.
