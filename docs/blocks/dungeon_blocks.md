    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Locked Blocks</h2>
    <p>
    Dungeon blocks within the boss arena are locked by default.
    Locked blocks behave exactly like their unlocked counterparts, with two key exceptions: they cannot be mined and they cannot be pushed.
    Once the boss is defeated, all locked blocks automatically become unlocked.
    Both carved and light block can be locked.
    Unlike the carved block, which is identical to the unlocked version, the light block loses some of its light output.
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Trapped Blocks</h2>
    <p>
    Among the many decorative blocks that make up the dungeon’s exterior and interior are Trapped Blocks. When a player walks over a trapped block a creature is released and block goes on cooldown.
    In the <a href="../../world_featrues/dungeon/maze">Maze</a>, these blocks spawn hostile <a href="../../entities/boss">sentries</a>, while in the <a href="../../world_featrues/dungeon/temple">Temple</a> they spawn peaceful <a href="../../entities/boss">valkyries</a>.
    A trapped block can only be activated by a player, but it can be triggered repeatedly, releasing additional enemies.
    Players in creative also have access to hellfire trap blocks spawning <a href="../../entities/boss">fireminions</a>.
    Additionally sentries and fireminions cannot be spawned by the trapped block while in peaceful mode.
    Lastly  
    trapped blocks can also spawn locked.
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Treasure Chest</h2>
    <p>
    The treasure chest hold the loot from a given boss.
    It cannot be mined nor moved, however it can be picked up and carried away.
    After defeating the boss of the dungeons player are given a <a href="../../items/items">key</a> that can be used to unlock the chest.
    Unlike in survival, the chest is accessible without a key in creative allowing map maker to populate the chest content with item of their own choice.
    Additionally treasure chest can be spawned via `/place` command.

## Dungeon Door
Once the boss fight begins, a dungeon door appears, preventing players inside the arena from leaving.
While players already in the fight cannot exit, players outside can still join by right-clicking the door.
When either all players inside die or the boss is defeated, the door disappears, allowing free movement in and out of the arena.
