Aether currently adds 273 blocks and counting. While some blocks are functional and have their own dedicated sections, most blocks are decorative. This wiki does not provide individual sections for decorative blocks.

This article will focus instead of individual block on groups of blocks. It will explain how to obtain each block, which tools to use to harvesting them, and any additional functionality they may have.
