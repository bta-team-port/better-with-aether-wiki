# Contributing to the Wiki
On this page I will quickly go over everything you need to know to contribute to this project.

## Requirements
To contribute to this wiki you will need to know how to use [GitHub](https://docs.github.com), [git](https://git-scm.com/), [MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/01/08/markdown-extension), [HTML](https://html.com/) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).
Understanding [Java](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) is crucial as you wont be able to get much or niche information without the necessary understanding of the code. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/bta-team-port/better-with-aether/tree/7.3).  
A mastery of these topic is not required, for most aspect a solid foundation and the motivation to learn is all it takes. 

All the nessery tutorial can be found here:  
- [git](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=de_DE), an interactive website teaching you how to use git  
- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/de/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world), basic understanding of how github works  
- [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), this blog has most of what you will need

**Git and GitHub are not related, skipping one will leave gaps in knowledge**

## Style Guide
This style guide is based on the [BTA-Wiki-Style](https://bta.miraheze.org/wiki/Better_than_Adventure!_Wiki:Style_guide) page. As such this will reiterate some of the more important aspects.
The default the language is the same as **BTA** as such *English (US)*. Other languages are only allowed if its a transcription.  
Contraction like for example "it's" and "they're" must be avoided.
No first or second person perspectives are to be avoided. Keep the wiki neutral and do not generalize. Item, block and entity names are to be capitalized like in-game.
Image captions or alt text should describe their importance to the article.

## Why is this not hosted as a Wiki?
A wiki was never planned. The original goal was to port the mod to **BTA** and nothing more. However over time enough the project grew aspect changed and new feature were added. When we have to explain what [pendant](items/accessories/pendant.md) do for the fifth time, we decided that it was about time to documents those features. This wiki is not meant to be an in depth explanation of any and all mechanics and aspect of **Better with Aether**.
We be happy to port this wiki to an actual wiki, given enough support, but for the time being this is the best we can offer.
