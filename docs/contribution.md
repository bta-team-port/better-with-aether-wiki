# Contribution
On this page I will quickly go over everything you need to know to contribute to this project.

## What required
This wiki is entirely written in [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and [HTML](). A basic understanding of both greatly help.  
This wiki is collaborative Project and as such requires you to be able to use [git]() and [github](). 
While the project does not require understanding of Programming or [Java](), we would highly recommended it. Understanding java allow you to read up on the source code. The source code can be found [here]()
